# Competitive Programming

This repository contains some of the competitive programming problems I solved in different online judges such as Uva, Codeforces, SPOJ, HackerRank, etc ...
I am trying to keep this repository updated with all the solutions I can retrieve (older solutions) and new problems I am solving.

I hope this can help/encourage everyone who is interested in competitive programming to keep practising.

Happy coding!
